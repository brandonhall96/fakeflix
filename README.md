# FakeFlix

Our App is called **FakeFlix** which is based off the well known movie streaming site 'Netflix'

It will demonstrate a combination of React, JavaScript, Express and MongoDB.
The App is pretty self explanatory, once a profile has been created the user will be able to login, choose movies and add them to a favorites or watchlist.
